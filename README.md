# T.Z.S-Android-Application

The aim of the project is to develop an Android based Smart phone application to preserve
expanse history for travelers. For example, if someone or a team wants to travel to Rajshahi at
first they budget for traveling. At the duration of their journey, they must be written in notebook where
how much money they spend and which purpose, and how much money they have to stay in
Rajshahi. At night they must calculate money and remember all of the expense history of money.
But if they use this app it will calculate all of this thing without any notebook or calculator. This
app is secure for the user because, without a username and password, anyone can’t see the user’s
information. This app also guides them to travel through Rajshahi City. This app indicates to 
travelers to find emergency amenities such as banks, atm, hospitals, doctors, bus/train stations, and so
forth. This application is to be installed on the Android based Smartphone. The project has been
developed using Java, XML, Android framework, Google map, and SQLite database.  
The Android studio is used as a  development environment.
